This is a basic school project.
This project was coded for an arduino nano and uses the Keypad.h and LiquidCrystal_I2C.h libraries to display the input information in a LCD screen using a 4x4 keypad. To control the motor via PWM and an array of relays you need to conect pin 11 to the control of the relays and pin 10 to the transistor control of the circuit.
